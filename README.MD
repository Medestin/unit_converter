## Unit converter
---

Write a simple unit converter:

- Should be a standalone application.
- Single threaded.
- Results should be printed to console.
- Input is passed as a command line params.
- Application can use external libraries.
- Application should contain tests.

Application should follow SOLID principles and it should be easy to add new conversions, for example liters to gallons.

Input format:

`<value> <unit_to_be_converted> <unit_after_conversion>`

for example:

`666 lb kg`
